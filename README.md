This is my version of a book reading app that stores all the books you want to read and have read in one place. You can pull up a list of upto 10 titles (for now)
of books on your TBR (To Be Read). You can add a new book to your library or you can look for books by title or author to see if you have them already on your list.
I have worked on this mainly using lists, importing a CSV and deep dived into Pandas which was an upward learning curve I thorougly enjoyed and sometimes pulled my 
hair out trying to understand.
A huge thank you to everyone who helped along the way, especially the CIP 4 discord group! Forever grateful to Chris and Mehran and the entire CiP 4 team who put
this years course together!
Finally!
This is a work in progress. I would love to add an public library API as well as graphics!
